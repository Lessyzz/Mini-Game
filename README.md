This project is just for education!

If you want to try that project you should put "minigame" folder to desktop.

Then when you run script, it is asking your computer username (If you don't know your's, you can go this path "C:\Users" you can find it here).

You shouldn't change to any pictures names.

That's all have fun!

That's my old project. So there are so many unnecessary lines. I was not know OOP.

If you want you can improve this project (more can be done).

I used to League of Legends images and characters, this way was easiest for me.
